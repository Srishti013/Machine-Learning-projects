# Machine-Learning-projects
This repo will contain all the machine learning projects I will do.
### 1) [Market Entry Analysis](/market_entry_analysis.pdf)<br> 
    This project basically uses techniques like clustering, classification and exploratory data analysis to 
    find whether it will be profitable for a Chinese company to enter market.The dataset of people of both 
    the countries has been provided in excel sheets.
### 2) [Netflix Movie Length Analysis](Netflix_movie_length_analysis/notebook.ipynb)<br>
    This project is a basic project in which exploratory data analysis is carried out to find out whether
    our null hypothesis is true or not. Our null hypothesis is that the average length of netflix movies has 
    decreased gradually from 2011 to 2020. 
### 3) [Google Playstore Data Analysis](google_playstore_analysis/notebook.ipynb)<br>    
    This project carries out the analysis of the data scrapped from playstore and uses it to 
    answer the following questions:
     * Which category has the highest share of (active) apps in the market?
     * Is any specific category dominating the market?
     * Which categories have the fewest number of apps?
     * Does the size of an app affect its rating?
     * Do users really care about system-heavy apps or do they prefer light-weighted apps?
     * Does the price of an app affect its rating?
     * Do users always prefer free apps over paid apps?
