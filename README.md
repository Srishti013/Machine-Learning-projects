# Machine-Learning-projects
This repo will contain all the machine learning projects I will do.
### 1) [Market Entry Analysis](/market_entry_analysis.pdf)<br> 
    This project basically uses techniques like clustering, classification and exploratory data analysis to 
    find whether it will be profitable for a Chinese company to enter market.The dataset of people of both the countries has been
    provided in excel sheets.
### 2) [Netflix Movie Length Analysis](Netflix_movie_length_analysis/notebook.ipynb)<br>
    This project is a basic project in which exploratory data analysis is carried out to find out whether
    our null hypothesis is true or not. Our null hypothesis is that the average length of netflix movies has decreased
    gradually from 2011 to 2020.
